#Custom Object Detection using OpenCV CPU and TensorFlow
Welcome to my Custom Object Detection project! This project is designed to provide a powerful tool for creating accurate object detection models using OpenCV CPU and TensorFlow. I use 3D models fake data generated in Unity to make the process of object detection more effective and engaging.

##The Power of Custom Object Detection
Custom object detection is a game-changer in today's technological landscape. It allows for the creation of highly accurate models for detecting specific objects, which has a wide range of applications, including medical research, security, and surveillance. My Custom Object Detection project leverages the power of OpenCV CPU and TensorFlow to provide the most accurate and customizable object detection models.

##A Unique Approach with Unity 3D
I use Unity 3D to generate 3D models fake data, which makes the process of object detection more effective and engaging. By utilizing 3D models, my project can simulate a real-world environment and provide more accurate data for training my models. This approach is particularly useful for XR technology applications like Alzheimer's research and other similar projects.

##User-Friendly and Customizable
My Custom Object Detection project is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable. The intuitive interface and detailed documentation make it easy for users of all skill levels to create powerful object detection models quickly and easily. Moreover, the project's flexibility allows for customization to meet the specific needs of different projects.

##Conclusion
My Custom Object Detection project is a powerful tool for employers looking to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation. With the power of OpenCV CPU and TensorFlow and the unique approach of using Unity 3D, my project can help advance XR technology for Alzheimer's research and other important projects. I invite you to explore my project and see for yourself what it can do for you.
